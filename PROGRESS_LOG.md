### üöß In Progress
- [ ] Real repository cloning and analysis
- [ ] Interactive visualizations (D3.js)
- [ ] 3D architecture maps (Three.js)
- [ ] Local LLM integration (Ollama)

### Phase 4: Core Functionality & UI Polish ‚úÖ COMPLETE
- **End-to-End Analysis Pipeline**: Activated the real analysis engine, replacing the mock data flow entirely.
- **Centralized State Management**: Refactored API routes to use a shared `analysisStore` for reliable data passing between requests.
- **Accurate Line Counting**: Fixed a bug in the analysis engine to use the AST for a precise line count, not just newline characters.
- **Expanded Repository Support**: Updated the repository fetching logic to include forked and collaborative repositories.
- **Categorized Dashboard**: Overhauled the dashboard UI to clearly separate repositories into "Owned", "Collaborations", and "Forks".
- **Fixed Ownership Bug**: Corrected a critical bug where repositories were misclassified by adding the user's GitHub username to the session for accurate comparison.

### üìã Next Steps
1.  **Phase 5: Multi-Language Support** (Next Session)
   - Integrate a Python parser (e.g., Tree-sitter's Python grammar).
   - Develop a Python-specific analyzer to walk the Python AST.
   - Update the analysis engine to route files based on their extension (`.py`, `.js`, etc.).

2.  **Phase 6: Interactive Visualizations**
   - D3.js dependency graphs with real data.
   - Three.js 3D architecture maps.

## üéØ Key Decisions Made

### Why Not Just GPT?
- **Real code analysis** vs AI chat
- **AST parsing** for actual structure understanding
- **Complexity metrics** for maintainability insights
- **Interactive visualizations** for better learning

### Design Philosophy
- **Linear-inspired** but with our own twist
- **Dark theme** for developer preference
- **Lime green branding** for fresh, energetic feel
- **Smooth animations** for premium feel
- **Glassmorphism** for modern aesthetic

### Technical Choices
- **Next.js 13+** for modern React features
- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **Tailwind CSS** for rapid development
- **Framer Motion** for animations
- **Local processing** for privacy and security

---

**Last Updated**: [Current Date]
**Session Duration**: ~5 hours
**Next Session Goal**: Phase 2 - Interactive Visualizations
**Current Theme**: Lime green with smooth easeInOut animations

- Refactored backend to normalize all file paths to repo-relative before grouping/relationships.
- Improved grouping logic (preparing to group by first two path segments for more granularity).
- Added full screen (expand) mode to dependency graph UI with modal overlay and Esc/close support.
- Added plans for further debugging: logging file paths, nodes, edges, and ensuring analysis freshness.
- Next: Will add more logging and grouping improvements, and debug analysis freshness before further features.
